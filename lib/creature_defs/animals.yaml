    description: "Rats were one of the few species that did manage to survive the freezing of
    the city, hiding in some part of the ancient sewer system.
    There, they scavenged what food they could, including potions and other magic items. Somehow,
    over the centuries, at least one strain evolved to produce rats the size of cats. Giant rats
    are usually encountered in small packs which have been known to overwhelm weak
    or wounded adventurers."

    description: "These hairy arachnids vary in size but are generally about the size of a wolf.

     larger prey. Although not particularly strong, ice spiders are swift, and their bite releases
      a dangerous venom."
