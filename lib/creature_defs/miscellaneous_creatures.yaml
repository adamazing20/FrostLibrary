    description: "Ever since the great storm that destroyed the city,
    frost giants have occasionally wandered down from the northern mountains.
    Possessed of rudimentary intelligence, they can occasionally be reasoned with but
    generally see humans (and most other animals) as little more than food."

    miscellaneousType: GiantWorm
    description: "The giant worms that move beneath the city are, like so many of the dangers
    of Frostgrave, a legacy of the old days. They were originally bred to clean the city’s sewer
    system, devouring all the waste. It is unknown if they were frozen and thawed or
    if they have been active and breeding in the last thousand years but, either way,
    it is clear that there is no longer enough food for them in the sewer system, and they
    often come out to hunt."

    description: "Large, dumb, and dangerous, the shaggy snow trolls encountered in the
    city are not to be taken lightly. Trolls consider anything that is alive and smaller than
    themselves to be food and will not hesitate to attack anyone they meet. Thankfully, trolls
    are slow and can usually be avoided or outpaced."

    miscellaneousType: Werewolf
    description: "The werewolves that inhabit the ruins of the city are not true lycanthropes.
    They are not shape shifters, but some kind of wolf–human hybrid.
    Although they live in small packs, they hunt alone and are thus normally encountered
    individually. The heads of werewolves are highly prized trophies."
