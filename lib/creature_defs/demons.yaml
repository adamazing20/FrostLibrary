    description: "Imps are generally the smallest and least powerful of demons.
    They tend to be smaller than a human, but the infinity of forms across the planes of
    existence means that they can appear as practically anything – a mass of flesh defined
    solely by a giant mouth, a spindly insect creature with vestigial wings, a crooked imitation
    of a man, a humanoid rat…"

    description: "Minor demons are close to human size, and while they come in an infinite
     number of forms, some distinct ‘species’ can be identified, such as the human–animal
     hybrids or the ‘gargoyles’ – hunched, grey-skinned creatures that find homes amongst the
     ruined architecture of Frostgrave."

    description: "Major demons are powerful entities.
    There is no limit to the size or shape they can take, and some are capable of
     changing form at will. They can appear as flawlessly beautiful humans, grotesque
      hybrids of multiple animals, giant amorphous blobs, floating spheres of light, or anything
      else that can be imagined. The stats given below are just a guideline, as major demons will
      often have their own magic powers or abilities, or access to a number of spells."
