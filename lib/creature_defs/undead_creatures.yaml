    description: "When a necromancer needs to send a message, hold a candle, or other minor task,
    they often animate a skull for the purpose. Usually, but not exclusively, human, these skulls
    can levitate a few feet above the ground and float around. Although not a huge threat, their
    broken-toothed bite can be extremely painful to those not paying enough attention."

    description: "Ghouls are the scavengers of the undead world and tend to be created by accident,
    when hunger or ignorance drives a living creature to consume the tainted flesh of the undead.
     Most of the ghouls currently haunting the ruins of Frostgrave were once adventurers who came
     to explore the city following the great thaw."

    description: "Most animated skeletons do not possess the manual dexterity to fire a bow.
    However, if the skeleton belonged to a skilled archer, then some of that ability is retained

    now and then."

    description: "Even at the height of its glory, the city had its problems with vampires.
    While a few vampires were powerful wizards or warriors, most were just parasitic
    creatures – too dangerous to allow to roam unchecked, too powerful to stamp out entirely.
    Being undead, these creatures just froze along with the rest of the city but now they too
    have thawed out. The stats given here represent a typical vampire."

    description: "‘Wraith’ is a catch-all term for the various forms of ethereal undead in the city,
     although ‘ghost’ and ‘wight’ are also used. It is not known how they are created,
     and no-one is sure if the ones currently haunting the city come from before or after
     its fall. What is known, though, is that a wraith is both extremely dangerous and hard to
     kill – their touch can drain a victim’s life force, and they are immune to mundane weapons."

    description: "Zombies probably outnumber all the other inhabitants of Frostgrave combined.
    Unlike skeletons, these undead were reanimated soon after death and still have most of
    their flesh. Before the cataclysm, zombies were chiefly used as household servants and
    messengers. Now, they have gone feral and hunger for living flesh."
