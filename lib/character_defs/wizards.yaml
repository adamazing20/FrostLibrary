    description: "Chromancers use magic to manipulate time itself. As the youngest branch of magic,
                  it is less developed and less understood than any of the others, and thus potentially
                  the most dangerous. Chronomancers tend to be gamblers and risk-taskers - those who
                  prefer a quick path to power. They have no specific style of dress, although they
                  tend to like outfits that project a sense of power and often carry an intimidating weapon,
                  even if they have little skill in using it. Given the powers they weild, Chronomancers are
                  just as likely to appear ancient as eternally youthful, and some may display elements of both,
                  such as a young face on an old body."

    wizardType: Elementalist
    description: "Elementalists are the most outwardly powerful type of wizard. Their magic is centered
                  on controlling the four elements, usually in loud, explosive, and unsubtle ways.
                  Their cloths tend to feature one bold colour(usually red, green or blue),
                  and they are more prone to flashy decorations than other wizards - facial tattoos
                  are not uncommon. Most Elementalists, especially those that specialize in the control of fire,
                  tend to have short tempers. While a Fire Elementalist may specialize in fire magic,
                  they are more than capable of harnessing the powers of Water, Wind, or Earth, should
                  it be necessary."

                  the least 'wizardly' looking of all wizards, being just as likely to carry craftsman's
                  tools as they are weapons or magic items."

                  and fear, and convince people of things that aren't true. In dress, Illusionists
                  are usually colorful, preferring bright, multi-colored robes, cloaks, and hats. They
                  rarely carry weapons or other magic equipment openly, preferring to produce these
                  items out of thin air as and when they are needed."

                  wear dark colours (most commonly black), and te nd to have a sickly, unhealthy
                  appearance. While Necromancers are not necessarily evil, there are few that have

                  both living and dead, and can see the mystical patterns in writing of all types.
                  Most famously, they are writers of magic scrolls and books, storing energy within
                  writing for later use. They are often physically weaker, bookish wizards and tend
                  not to carry any weapons other than a staff, but often end up loaded down with
                  books and scrolls."

    wizardType: Soothsayer
    description: "The subtle magic of a Soothsayer allows the wizard to extend their senses beyond
                  their body, including through time itself. They can reach into the past and learn
                  the secrets of history or gaze into the future to catch a glimpse of things to come.
                  They can even reach into the minds of other beings. There are very few young Soothsayers
                  as the patience and concentration required favours the old. Soothsayers are the most
                  easily recognizable by their eyes, which are almost always very pale, and often possess
                  a distant, empty gaze. Because Soothsayers often collect items of clothing with
                  interesting histories, they tend to wear an odd mix of clothing and equipment -
                  a Soothsayer sees nothing odd about combining and expensive cloak with worn and badly
                  stained robes or hanging an old seashell on a leather strap right next to a priceless
                  emerald."

    description: "Summoners work their magic by opening doorways to different planes of existence.
                  This is usually to bring forth creatures from these other planes to use as servants,
                  although this is not the limit of this school of magic. It is perhaps worth metioning
                  that the term 'demon' refers to any being from another plane of existence - demons
                  are not all necessarily evil, nor do they all have horns or hooves. That said, demons
                  are rarely happy about being summoned, and the life of a Summoner is a dangerous one."

    description: "Thaumaturges draw their magic powers from positive energy. Most, though not
                  all, believe that this energy comes from some form of deity. These wizards are
                  healers and protectors, who often spend as much time on good works as they do on
                  the study of magic. Thaumaturges rarely carry any weapon other than a staff and
                  some find even that a bit aggressive. This is not to say the Thaumaturges are
                  pacifists, however, just that most prefer to avoid obvious displays of force.
                  In appearance, they usually wear plain, simple robes and tend to favour hoods over
                  hats, and wood and leather over gold and silk."
