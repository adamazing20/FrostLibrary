    description: "TWizard only. This spell has no specific school of wizardry,
    so the modifiers for aligned, neutral and opposed schools do not apply.
    After each game, a wizard may make one attempt to cast Transcendence.
    If the spell succeeds, the wizard is immediately transported to a higher
    plane of existence and has essentially ‘won’ the campaign. Players must
    decide amongst themselves if they should declare the campaign over, or if
    they should continue with the remaining wizards to see if any of them can
    also obtain Transcendence. In such a case, the player who has just won should
    be allowed to create a new wizard and warband (probably at a somewhat more
    advanced level) in order to continue playing. With the other players’ agreement,
    they can promote their apprentice to be their new wizard, but this apprentice will
    be so close to reaching Transcendence themselves that it may seem a bit redundant."
